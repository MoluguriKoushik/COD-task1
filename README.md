TASK ONE: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
Objective
The goal of this task is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice. This involves using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to understand the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. Visualizing these aspects will help gain deeper insights into the dataset.

Dataset
For this task, we will be using a dataset named Cars_data, which contains various features of cars, including make, model, year, engine details, transmission type, and more.

Columns in the Dataset
Make: Manufacturer of the car.
Model: Model of the car.
Year: Year the car model was released.
Engine Fuel Type: Type of fuel the car's engine uses.
Engine HP: Horsepower of the car's engine.
Engine Cylinders: Number of cylinders in the car's engine.
Transmission Type: Type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual).
Driven_Wheels: Type of driven wheels (e.g., front, rear, all).
Number of Doors: Number of doors on the car.
Market Category: Market category the car belongs to.
Vehicle Size: Size classification of the car (e.g., compact, midsize).
Vehicle Style: Style of the car (e.g., sedan, SUV).
highway MPG: Fuel efficiency on the highway.
city mpg: Fuel efficiency in the city.
Popularity: Popularity of the car model.
MSRP: Manufacturer's suggested retail price.

Conclusion:

From the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Cars_data dataset, several insights have emerged:

Data Quality and Cleaning:

Missing values were identified and handled appropriately.
Data types were verified and converted to ensure accuracy.
Distribution of Numerical Features:

Engine HP and MSRP both exhibit right-skewed distributions, indicating most cars have lower horsepower and are lower-priced, with fewer high-end, high-horsepower vehicles.
Categorical Feature Analysis:

Certain manufacturers dominate the Make column.
Diverse options are available in Transmission Type and Driven_Wheels.
Bivariate Analysis:

A positive correlation exists between Engine HP and MSRP, suggesting higher horsepower cars are more expensive.
MSRP varies significantly across different Vehicle Styles, indicating style influences price.
Correlation Analysis:

The heatmap reveals strong correlations, such as between Engine HP and MSRP, and highway MPG and city mpg, suggesting that certain features strongly influence each other.
